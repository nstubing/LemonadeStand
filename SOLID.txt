One of the places that I utilized th single use part of SOLID was in the display of the store items. I wanted to specifically talk about this 
case because from the look of it, it is repetetive and from the amounts of lines it lookes like it does a lot. Each item and each items amounts 
required a different case to be loaded after each click of the up or down arrow key. Looking back at it now, I should have split up the 
methods that contain the display(Item)Highlight methods because they are doing too much, but the display item methods are doing one thing only and 
doing it well.  Now that I have a little more experience with Interfaces I think that would have been the perfect way to make this UI
quick, SOLID, and much much more concise so if I have a bit of free time in the future I am going to go back and try to streamline the process
becuase interfaces seem to be extremely useful.  One spot where I used the O in SOLID well was when the player is picking how many days they 
want to play and the daysPlaying member variable is set. The game class has the daysPlaying variable that is used in the RunGameDays method to run a new day however many times
the playing wants.  This leaves the opportunity for extension open if I wanted to add the ability to play for 31 days or a year, and there is no need to change the
RunGameDays method which makes it very SOLID.  It Runs the days of the game and it runs them well.
